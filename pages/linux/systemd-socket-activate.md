# `systemd-socket-activate` - Socket Activation for Systemd

`systemd-socket-activate` is a command used in the systemd init system to activate sockets for service processes. It is designed to improve the performance and efficiency of services by enabling them to start only when a connection is made to a specific socket.

Socket activation is a feature in systemd that allows services to delay their startup until a connection is made to a socket, reducing resource consumption and improving responsiveness.

## Usage
`systemd-socket-activate [OPTIONS] [SPECIAL SOCKET ...]`


## Options

- `-h, --help`: Show help message and exit.

## Examples

1. **Activate a Socket Service:**
   To activate a service when a specific socket is connected, use the following command:
   ```bash
   systemd-socket-activate /path/to/socket.service
   ```

2. **Activate Socket Service with Specified Port:**
    If your service requires a specific port, you can specify it when activating the service:
   ```bash
   systemd-socket-activate /path/to/socket.service -l 8080
   ```
